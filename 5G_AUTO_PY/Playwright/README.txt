Playwright: it writes scripts!

To run: python Playwright

Playwright scans a repository of files and creates a palette of buttons to order and manipulate the scripts.

At some point it will send this new formulated script off to the ssh destination, which we will figure out.
Playwright is intended to receive the files and shell scripts in the formatted text generated by other components
of the 5G automation project.
